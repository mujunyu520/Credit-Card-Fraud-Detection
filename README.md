### Step 0: Clean Data

Obtain data from[ KaggleLinks](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) to an external site.. Remove all duplicates. For the attribute "class", change 0 to -1 so that -1 represents normal and +1 represents fraud. 
After this, the resulting dataset should contain 473 fraud and 283253 normal transactions.
